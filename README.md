# Emoji in practice

Emoji are ideograms and smileys used in electronic messages and web pages. Some examples of emoji are 😃, 🧘🏻‍♂️, 🌍, 🍞, 🚗, 📞, 🎉. Nowadays it is a part of Unicode(13.0) which include about 1,367 characters and widely we use them in kind of platfroms to communicate wich each.

## Purpose

New Emojis were added to Unicode continuously. I believed that we could exploit emoji and use them in front-end or back-end that we can enjoy and share our thought through them in coding, even become a standard.
